## Analysis of Cattle Birth Patterns in Ireland for the Year 2016

### Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of cattle birth data in Ireland for the year 2016. The analysis is conducted using R, focusing on birth patterns across different months, comparison of beef and dairy breed births, and statistical evaluation of birth data using various R packages such as `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `janitor`, and custom S3 class creation for advanced data handling. 

### Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the European Union Open Data Portal, specifically the "Cattle Births in Ireland 2016" dataset. The dataset contains information about the number of cattle births by month, county, and breed type (beef or dairy).

### Data Preparation
- **Cleaning:** The data was first loaded and cleaned to ensure uniformity in month representation. The `janitor` package was used to clean the column names for consistency.
- **Conversion:** The month abbreviations in the dataset were converted to numerical values for easier analysis.
- **Summarization:** Data was grouped by month and breed type to obtain total births and summarized using descriptive statistics.

### Analysis and Visualization
- **Total Births by Month:** A bar chart was created to visualize the total number of cattle births for each month in 2016. This revealed a seasonal pattern in cattle breeding, with a peak in February and March.
- **Breed Comparison:** Another bar chart compared the total number of births between beef and dairy breeds, showing a significant predominance of beef births over dairy.
- **Advanced Statistics:** Using a custom S3 class `CattleStats`, we calculated the mean, median, and standard deviation of cattle births for each month. This data was visualized in a comparative bar chart, highlighting the variability and central tendency of cattle births throughout the year.

### Key Findings
- **Seasonality:** The data shows a clear seasonality in cattle births, with the highest numbers in early spring, suggesting that breeding schedules are likely aligned with favorable environmental conditions.
- **Breed Predominance:** Beef breeds had a significantly higher number of births compared to dairy breeds, which could reflect market demands or specific breeding practices in 2016.
- **Statistical Insights:** The analysis of mean, median, and standard deviation of cattle births provided insights into the variability of births across different months, with notable peaks in February and high variability in January.

### R Packages Used
- **dplyr:** For data manipulation and summarization.
- **ggplot2:** For creating visualizations.
- **janitor:** For cleaning data and creating frequency tables.
- **Custom S3 Class:** For creating a tailored data structure to handle and analyze cattle birth statistics.

### How to Run the Code
1. Ensure that you have the necessary R packages installed (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `janitor`).
2. Load the dataset and execute the provided R scripts in sequence.
3. The analysis will generate visualizations and statistical summaries as described in the key findings.

### Conclusion
This project offers a comprehensive look at cattle birth trends in Ireland for 2016, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the cattle industry and researchers interested in agricultural data analysis.
